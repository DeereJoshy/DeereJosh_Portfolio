According to data from [Statista] https://www.statista.com/statistics/245478/self-described-religious-identification-of-americans/ Protestant and Catholic populations have declined steadily since the 70s, leading to now where 22% of the population don’t consider themselves religious.\n\n\nShow the code\nprint('The number of people in 1999 with the name Josh:')\njosh = df.query('name == \"Josh\"')\njosh.query('year == 1999')\nfig = px.line(josh, \n  x='year' , \n  y='Total', \n  title='The Rise and Fall of Josh',\n  markers= True\n)\nfig.add_shape(\n  type = 'line',\n  line_color = 'red',\n  line_width = 2,\n  opacity = 1,\n  line_dash = 'dot',\n  x0=0,\n  x1=1,\n  xref='paper',\n  y0 = 130,\n  y1 = 130,\n  yref = 'y'\n)\nfig.add_annotation(\n  text = 'My Birthday line',\n  x=1950,\n  y=140,\n  arrowhead=1,\n  showarrow=True\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\nThe number of people in 1999 with the name Josh:",
