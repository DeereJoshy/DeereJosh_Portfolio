# What's in a name?

## Elevator pitch

_Bible names have seen many twists and turns and any have fallen out of popularity compared to that of the 60s and 70s. This may be attributed to varying parenting styles or changes in culture as religion has began to fall out of the mainstream. Very few consider themselves reilgious or practicing, thus the downwards trend in use for most names_

__Questions and Tasks__

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__1. How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?__

_The number of people named Josh was post-slump following the 70s. The 60s and 70s saw a huge spike in use, but was followed by a sharp drop in the 80s and 90s. Nearing 2015 is one of the lowest points since the 40s. I was born in 1999 which was near a drop._

```{python}
print('The number of people in 1999 with the name Josh:')
josh = df.query('name == "Josh"')
josh.query('year == 1999')
fig = px.line(josh, 
  x='year' , 
  y='Total', 
  title='The Rise and Fall of Josh',
  markers= True
)
fig.update_traces()
fig.show()
```

## QUESTION|TASK 2

__2. If you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of his or her age? What ages would you not guess?__

_The name Brittany was extremely common in the 90s. My guess is that a Brittany is most likely in their 30s or 40s. It's also a coincidence that my mother is named Brittany which helps give me a gauge on where it lies. Most likely they aren't in their 20s considering the usage rates are almost as low as the 70s._

```{python}
#| label: Q2
#| code-summary: Query the data to show only Brittany
brittany = df.query('name == "Brittany"')
fig = px.bar(brittany, x='year', y='Total', title='How old is Brittany?')
fig.show()
```


## QUESTION|TASK 3

__3. Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul are all Christian names. From 1920 - 2000, compare the name usage of each of the four names. What trends do you notice?__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: Q3
#| code-summary: Filter to show names only and date ranges. Graph to show data.
gb = df.groupby('name')
gb.first()
