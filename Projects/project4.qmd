## Elevator pitch

_This project is on creating a model that can predict whether a home was built prior to implementation of rules on asbestos. I found that the best metrics for prediction are the number of dwelling units, stories in the home, and the number of car space in the garage._

```{python}
#| label: project data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data
# Load data
dwellings_ml = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4dwellings/raw/master/data-raw/dwellings_ml/dwellings_ml.csv')
```

__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980. Explain what you learn from the charts that could help a machine learning algorithm.__

_Looking at the number of bedrooms and dwelling units, I can see some semblance of pattern in determining the likelihood of a home being built before 1980. The number of car space in the garage also is a solid predictor._

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
fig = px.histogram(dwellings_ml, x = 'numbdrm', y = 'stories',color = 'before1980')#,barmode='group',color_discrete_map={0:'RebeccaPurple',1:'MediumPurple'})
fig.show()
```

```{python}
fig = px.scatter(dwellings_ml, x = 'totunits', y = 'nocars',color = 'before1980')
fig.show()
```

## QUESTION|TASK 2

__Build a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”. Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: Q2
#| code-summary: Read and format data
#| Include and execute your code here
 X = dwellings_ml[['nocars', 'totunits', 'stories', 'numbdrm']]
 y = dwellings_ml['before1980']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=24, stratify=y)

rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=24)  
rf.fit(X, y)  

accuracy_score(X, y)  

```

## QUESTION|TASK 3

__Justify your classification model by discussing the most important features selected by your model. This discussion should include a chart and a description of the features.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: Q3
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here


```

## QUESTION|TASK 4

__Describe the quality of your classification model using 2-3 different evaluation metrics. You also need to explain how to interpret each of the evaluation metrics you use.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: Q4
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
